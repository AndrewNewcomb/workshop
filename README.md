This is part of a workshop developed for the Prog F# Tutorials in London
(2106). The slide deck is meant to be the driver of the tutorial and the
speaker notes are provided to help guide those who might want to self-study
the content or take this home with them. Please follow along with slides.pdf.

The current version of the repository is left incomplete without solutions for
the duration of the tutorial. A completed version will be uploaded later for
reference.

Questions and contributions are welcome to this repository. Feel free to open
an issue.
